# Decisions

One ADR per decision a later task could undo without knowing it was a
decision. Append; never rewrite an entry that is already here — to replace
one, strike its heading through and point at the number that supersedes it.

## ADR 1 — A local board is a directory of JSON cards, and stores dispatcher vocabulary

**Status:** accepted (T-008, 2026-09-25).

**Context.** `dispatcher/vibe_kanban_client.py` is a four-method seam
(`list_issues`, `get_issue`, `create_issue`, `set_status`) built for a board
that no longer exists: `docs/ROADMAP.md` records the 2026-09-25 re-run where
`create_issue` fails with `project_id is required` against a retired service.
Every run to date has used `NullKanbanClient`, so two prioritized items in the
README — debt cards and epic decomposition — wait on a `create_issue` that
works. `docs/plans/board.md` "Phase 0 — `LocalBoardClient`" is the spec this
implements.

**Decision.** `LocalBoardClient` stores one JSON document per issue under
`local_board.dir`, named `<issue_id>.json`, written with a temp file in that
directory and `os.replace` the way `dispatcher/state_machine.py` writes account
state. Within that:

- Ids are `uuid4`, minted by the client. `dispatcher/cli.py:_seed_kanban_issue_id`
  rejects a `--kanban-issue-id` that is not a uuid, and short ids would mean
  relaxing that check. `simple_id` stays `None`: a display handle is the UI's
  problem, and it can number by `created_at`.
- A card holds exactly the fields in `CARD_FIELDS` — `issue_id`, `title`,
  `description`, `status`, `created_at`.
- `status` is the dispatcher's own string, stored verbatim: `set_status` writes
  `in_progress:implementador` as it comes, with no `status_map`. There is no
  column here to rename, so the role — the one dimension a generic board
  flattens — survives on the card.
- `list_issues(**filters)` matches `CARD_FIELDS` by equality and raises
  `ValueError` on any other key. A filter whose value is `None` is dropped, as
  `VibeKanbanClient` drops it.
- `set_status` on an id with no card raises `LookupError`, where the remote
  client warns and carries on. A remote board could legitimately be out of
  sync; local storage that has forgotten a card the task file still points at
  is a bug. Every call site in `dispatcher/dispatcher.py`
  (`_update_task_status`, `_open_kanban_issue`) already catches `Exception` and
  logs, so this surfaces without threatening a run.
- `get_issue` is a lookup and returns `None` for anything it cannot answer. A
  missing file is silent: it is the ordinary "no such issue". The other three
  each log a warning, because each means someone wrote something this client
  did not — a document that will not parse, a document that parses but carries
  no string `issue_id`, and an id that is not a bare filename.
- A missing directory is a board with no issues. The first write creates it.

**Consequences.** Phase 1's read API and Phase 2's UI read these documents, so
a status they render is `in_progress:<role>` and not a column name; sorting a
board by age means `created_at`, the only order the random ids allow. Adding a
stored field widens what `list_issues` accepts and has to be added to
`CARD_FIELDS`; removing one breaks a caller that filters on it. The client
caches nothing, so two clients over one directory see each other's writes —
which is what lets `dispatch run-task` and a later `dispatch learnings` agree,
and what a Phase 1 reader relies on. Nothing here is dispatch state:
`.hive/tasks/*.md` remains the source of truth, per `docs/plans/board.md`
"Architecture decisions".

## ADR 2 — Two boards configured is a startup error, not a precedence rule

**Status:** accepted (T-008, 2026-09-25).

**Context.** `config.yaml` now has two optional board blocks, `vibe_kanban` and
`local_board`, and a run talks to one board. `dispatcher/cli.py:_kanban()`
picks in that order, so a silent rule was available.

**Decision.** `dispatcher/config.py:_load_boards` raises when both blocks are
present, with a message naming which one to drop. Both blocks remain opt-in:
with neither, a run gets `NullKanbanClient` and says nothing about a board, so
an upgraded harness does not start writing cards it was never asked for.
`--kanban-issue-id` is accepted with either block and refused with neither —
the check is "no board", not "no MCP".

**Consequences.** An operator who writes both gets a failed startup rather than
a board nothing moves. Phase 2 is where the local board's default is meant to
flip on (`docs/plans/board.md` "Configuration"); doing that means deciding what
an existing `vibe_kanban` block then means, and this ADR is why that cannot be
"the local one wins quietly".

## ADR 3 — The read API reads cards from a local board only, and never dials a remote one

**Status:** accepted (T-009, 2026-09-26).

**Context.** `docs/plans/board.md` "Phase 1 — a read API in Python" makes a
task's `card` the board document its `kanban_issue_id` points at, and the
harness has two board implementations. `VibeKanbanClient` reaches its board by
spawning `vibe_kanban.command` as an MCP subprocess per call, over stdio, with
no timeout — and `observability/api/Dockerfile` is `python:3.11-slim`, which has
no node and no `npx`.

**Decision.** `observability/api/app.py:_read_cards` builds
`LocalBoardClient(cfg.local_board)` when `local_board` is configured and reads
no board otherwise. A harness configured with `vibe_kanban` gets `card: null`
on every task plus one warning in the envelope saying so, per request that
would have read a card. It is not an error, and it is not silence either.

**Consequences.** A read endpoint that promises never to 500 also never blocks
on a subprocess it cannot kill, and the image stays a Python image. The cost is
that a `vibe_kanban` harness sees no cards through this API; the way to change
that is a board client that speaks HTTP to something, not a socket or a
toolchain in this image. Phase 2 reads `warnings`, so the reason arrives with
the nulls. This is also why the API builds its own client instead of taking
`dispatcher/cli.py:_kanban()`: that factory is for a dispatcher that must not
know which board it got, and this service is the one caller that has to.

## ADR 4 — `unreadable()` is the one name the board seam does not carry, and `card` is a `KanbanIssue`

**Status:** accepted (T-009, 2026-09-26).

**Context.** `docs/debt/T-008-D2.md`: a card that will not parse is skipped by
`list_issues` with a log line, so a reader gets a board that is quietly short.
Phase 1's envelope is where that shortfall was meant to surface, and surfacing
it needs a method only the local board can have — every other client's skips
happen on a server. `docs/learnings/the-kanban-seam-is-a-closed-surface.md`
says the seam is closed at five public names.

**Decision.** `LocalBoardClient.unreadable() -> list[str]` returns the paths
`list_issues` skipped, over the same single directory scan (`_scan`).
`dispatcher/dispatcher.py` must never call it — it does not know which
implementation it holds — and
`tests/dispatcher/test_vibe_kanban_client.py:LOCAL_BOARD_ONLY` names it as the
one exception, so the parity test still fails on the next local-only addition.
That test was also rewritten: it compared `LocalBoardClient`'s public names
against the union of both clients', which contains them by construction, so it
had never failed a superset at all.

A task's `card` is `dataclasses.asdict` of the `KanbanIssue` the seam answers
with — `issue_id`, `title`, `status`, `simple_id` — and not the stored JSON
document. The document's other two fields, `description` and `created_at`, are
reachable only through `_read_card`, and a read API is not the place to reach
past a seam this project keeps deliberately narrow.

**Consequences.** Phase 2 can render a card's title and its
`in_progress:<role>` status, and cannot render its description or order cards
by `created_at` — the two things ADR 1 says a UI would want `created_at` for.
Getting them means widening the seam for every client in one change, with its
own ADR, which is exactly the cost the learning above says it should carry.
`unreadable()` costs one extra directory scan per request that reads cards,
because `list_issues` and `unreadable` are two calls; the scan is shared code,
not a second parser.

## ADR 5 — The envelope's other half: what a read API answers when the read fails

**Status:** accepted (T-009, 2026-09-26).

**Context.** `docs/plans/board.md` pins every 200 as
`{"data": …, "warnings": […]}` and says one unreadable file must never empty
`data` or 500. It does not say what a non-200 body looks like, nor what a
single-object endpoint answers when the one file it was asked for is the
unreadable one — and Phase 2 is written against whatever this phase did.

**Decision.** In `observability/api/app.py`:

- Every non-200 *this module returns*, but the 401, is
  `{"error": "<one sentence naming what was wrong>"}`. There is no `warnings`
  key on an error: nothing was read. The two Flask raises for itself are not
  covered and are not JSON: a path no route matches answers 404 and a write
  verb on a route answers 405, both `text/html` with a Werkzeug page. Measured,
  not assumed. A Phase 2 client that calls `.json()` on any non-200 therefore
  has to guard the content type, which is the cheaper half of the trade — an
  `errorhandler` per status would make the promise true at the cost of hiding
  a typo'd path behind the same envelope shape a real endpoint answers with.
- 400 for an unknown query parameter, for a non-integer `limit`/`since`, for a
  non-positive `limit`, for a `limit`/`since` outside the signed 64-bit range
  SQLite can bind, and for an absent `project` where `projects_root` holds
  more than one checkout. An empty value (`?limit=&since=`) reads as absent, so
  the URL the plan writes out is a legal request. The range check is a 400 and
  not a caught exception because it is a fact about the request: `int()` parsing
  the text does not mean `LIMIT ?` can bind the result, and `OverflowError` there
  is neither a `sqlite3.Error` nor a `ValueError`. It is not the cap on how much
  a caller may ask for; that is debt this phase declared and did not take.
- 404 for a task id with no file, a task id that is not a bare filename, a
  project slug with no checkout, and a `projects_root` with no checkouts at all.
- A file that exists and will not parse is never a 404: `/api/tasks/<id>`
  answers 200 with `data: null` and a warning naming the file, because a 404
  there would deny a file the operator is looking at.
- An account whose state file will not parse stays in `data` with `state`,
  `current_task` and `rate_limited_at` null, plus a warning naming the file: the
  account is configured whatever its state file says, and dropping it would
  hide an account from the page that watches the pool.
- A missing or unopenable events database, and a missing debt index, are `[]`
  plus a warning. Neither is an error: a harness that has never run has no
  events, and a project that has filed no debt has no index.
- A `local_board.dir` that cannot be listed at all — it is a regular file, the
  mount is gone, or its cards will not sort against each other — is every
  `card` null plus one warning naming the directory, not a 500.
  `LocalBoardClient._scan` raises for anything but a missing directory, and
  correctly so: for the dispatcher a board that reads as empty would let
  `create_issue` mint cards nobody can list, and a card's fields are text some
  phase wrote of which only `issue_id` is checked on the way in. The widening
  belongs on this side of the seam, where never-500 is the contract.
- **Never-500 is bounded, and the bound is a guard and not a promise about
  Flask.** Each task row is read, shaped *and* serialised inside one `try`:
  a frontmatter value of the wrong type raises where it is used — as a dict
  key in `_task`, or inside `jsonify` — and both points are covered, so such a
  task costs a warning naming its file. Two things stay outside it, both
  measured. The 404 and 405 Flask raises for itself are HTML, as the first
  bullet says. And the guard is per task row: a value that reaches `_envelope`
  from `/api/accounts`, `/api/events` or `/api/debt` is not serialisation-
  checked, because those three shape their own rows out of `str` and `int` and
  have no frontmatter to carry a `set`. A later endpoint that returns anything
  a parser built inherits the obligation, not the guarantee.

**Consequences.** A Phase 2 client can treat `data === null` and `data === []`
as "nothing to show, read `warnings`" and reserve its error path for non-200s.
A later endpoint added here inherits all of it, including the rule that
`warnings` names files rather than describing states. `warnings` is unbounded in
length, and so is `limit`: neither has a cap, which is a cost this phase chose
to leave — see `docs/debt/`.
